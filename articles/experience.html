          <h2>Lead Video Editor</h2>
          <p> I am currently employed as a Lead Video Editor at a charity organization. I was one of the first people to work at the charity so my role has slowly changed over time. I mainly edit all of the video for the organization as well do some basic website design. </p>
          <p>This job has peaked my interest in web developement. We are planning on developing an application so I would like to be apart of this process.</p>

        <h2>Music Production</h2>
        <p> For the last 10 year I have produced music as a hobby. Through making music I have familiarized myself with various programs such as Ableton Live and Max.</p>
        <p>While using Max I was able to pick up some basic coding techniques in order to creat my own effects in Ableton</p>
